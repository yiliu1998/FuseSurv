Description: Provides tools for estimating treatment-specific survival curves
    for a target site by borrowing information from multiple source sites under
    data-sharing constraints. The package implements target-site-only,
    density-ratio-adjusted local estimators, a federated weighting estimator that
    adaptively combines source information, and a semiparametric efficient CCOD 
    (CCOD: common conditional outcome distribution) estimator. Optional functions
    return  additional contrasts such as risk difference, survival ratio, and 
    restricted mean survival time.
